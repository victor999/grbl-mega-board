# grbl-mega-board
Board for grbl-mega 5 axis project

Designed in Eagle

https://github.com/fra589/grbl-Mega-5X

Tested in XYZXAB CNC configuration with MIN limit switches and TB6600 drivers. 

Connectors designed with approach to direct connection to drivers without swapping wires - first pin on connector, first pin on driver and so on

It means double X axis with separate limit switches, so no problems with squaring

Can be configured also for double Y or whatever you want

Current config is for XYZX
